//the reason why we need a babel rc file is

//JSX is not valid JavaScript syntax, so it needs to be transformed by Babel into valid JavaScript code that can be interpreted by the browser. In order to do that,
//you need to use a Babel preset that includes the @babel/preset-react plugin. This preset can be included in your .babelrc file or in your Webpack configuration file.
